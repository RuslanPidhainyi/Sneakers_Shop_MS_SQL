The Sneakers shop is a demo version of a database. I use Microsoft SQL Server for data storage, and the query language is Transact-SQL. In this project, I demonstrate my skills in database creation, data population, writing queries, and using Functions, Procedures, and Views. This project was completed in 2021 as part of the "Introduction to Databases" course.

My database contains: 
- 13 tables (+1 operation performed using the INTO keyword for copying data),
- 12 queries,
- 3 views,
- 3 procedures,
- 3 functions.

Here are the database diagrams below
